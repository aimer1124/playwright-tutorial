    âœ” Success! Created a Playwright Test project at /Users/jackson/Documents/Github/playwright-tutorial/Day1

    Inside that directory, you can run several commands:

    pnpm exec playwright test
        Runs the end-to-end tests.

    pnpm exec playwright test --ui
        Starts the interactive UI mode.

    pnpm exec playwright test --project=chromium
        Runs the tests only on Desktop Chrome.

    pnpm exec playwright test example
        Runs the tests in a specific file.

    pnpm exec playwright test --debug
        Runs the tests in debug mode.

    pnpm exec playwright codegen
        Auto generate tests with Codegen.

    We suggest that you begin by typing:

        pnpm exec playwright test

    And check out the following files:
    - ./tests/example.spec.ts - Example end-to-end test
    - ./playwright.config.ts - Playwright Test configuration

    Visit https://playwright.dev/docs/intro for more information. âœ¨

    Happy hacking! ðŸŽ­

### Run the first test
- In terminal, run:
  ```bash
  pnpm exec playwright test
  ```
- The output like this:
    ```bash
    jackson@192 Day1 % pnpm exec playwright test

    Running 6 tests using 4 workers
    6 passed (16.0s)

    To open last HTML report run:

    pnpm exec playwright show-report
    ```
- To see the report, run:
  ```bash
  pnpm exec playwright show-report
  ```
  It will open in browser [http://localhost:9323/](http://localhost:9323/), the report like this:
  ![Report](./image/image.png)

  Close report server by `Ctrl + C` in terminal.
